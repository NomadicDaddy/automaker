    "content": "Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Automaker project! This is an impressive AI-powered development studio with a Kanban board, multi-model agent support, and autonomous feature development. Let me provide you with some great feature ideas that would enhance this project:\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Feature Suggestions for Automaker\n\nBased on my analysis of your codebase, here are some features that would be valuable additions:\n\n### 1. **📊 Analytics Dashboard**\n- **What**: A view showing metrics like features completed over time, agent success rates, time-to-completion per feature, cost tracking per model used, etc.\n- **Why**: Helps users understand productivity gains and optimize their AI model selections\n\n### 2. **🔄 Feature Dependencies/Linking**\n- **What**: Allow features to have dependencies on other features (e.g., \"Feature B can only start after Feature A is verified\")\n- **Why**: Complex projects often have dependent features; this enables better planning and automatic sequencing\n\n### 3. **📝 Code Review View**\n- **What**: A dedicated view showing all changes made by agents with inline diff annotations, approval/rejection buttons, and the ability to cherry-pick specific changes\n- **Why**: Currently you have `git-diff-panel.tsx` but a full code review experience would improve verification workflows\n\n### 4. **🗂️ Feature Templates**\n- **What**: Pre-defined feature templates (e.g., \"Add REST endpoint\", \"Create React component\", \"Add database migration\") with common steps already filled in\n- **Why**: Reduces repetitive work and standardizes feature definitions\n\n### 5. **💬 Agent Chat per Feature**\n- **What**: Attach a chat/conversation thread to each feature card for discussing implementation details, asking clarifying questions, or giving additional context mid-execution\n- **Why**: Enables more interactive feature development rather than one-shot execution\n\n### 6. **📅 Sprint/Milestone Management**\n- **What**: Group features into sprints or milestones with deadlines, progress tracking, and burndown charts\n- **Why**: Brings more project management capabilities for teams or long-term projects\n\n### 7. **🔔 Notification System**\n- **What**: Desktop notifications when agents complete, fail, or need approval + optional integrations (Slack, Discord, email)\n- **Why**: Users can context-switch while agents work and get notified of important events\n\n### 8. **🧪 Test Runner Integration**\n- **What**: Built-in test runner view that shows test results, coverage reports, and allows re-running specific tests\n- **Why**: Currently tests are run by agents but a dedicated UI would improve the TDD workflow\n\n### 9. **📸 Screenshot/Recording Capture**\n- **What**: Ability to capture screenshots or record short videos of the running app and attach them to features\n- **Why**: Great for bug reports, visual features, and documentation\n\n### 10. **🎯 Smart Feature Estimation**\n- **What**: AI-powered complexity/effort estimation for features based on codebase analysis and historical data\n- **Why**: Helps with planning and setting realistic expectations\n\n### 11. **🔍 Codebase Search**\n- **What**: A dedicated search view with semantic search capabilities (find code by describing what it does, not just keywords)\n- **Why**: Helps users navigate large codebases and find relevant code faster\n\n### 12. **📋 Clipboard/Snippet Manager**\n- **What**: Quick-access panel for frequently used code snippets, prompts, or context that can be dragged into features\n- **Why**: Speeds up feature creation with reusable components\n\n### 13. **🔀 Branch Visualization**\n- **What**: Visual git graph showing feature branches, their status, and relationship to main branch\n- **Why**: With worktree support, visualizing the git state becomes more important\n\n### 14. **📜 Activity Feed/Timeline**\n- **What**: A timeline view showing all activity across the project (features started, completed, commits made, errors occurred)\n- **Why**: Provides at-a-glance project activity overview\n\n### 15. **🤖 Agent Collaboration Mode**\n- **What**: Allow multiple agents to work on related features simultaneously with awareness of each other's changes\n- **Why**: Your concurrent agent support could be enhanced with coordination\n\n### 16. **📚 Documentation Generator**\n- **What**: Auto-generate README, API docs, or component documentation from the codebase and features\n- **Why**: Keep documentation in sync with code automatically\n\n### 17. **🔐 Secrets/Environment Management**\n- **What**: Secure storage and management for API keys, environment variables per project\n- **Why**: Currently using `.env` files; a more robust secrets manager would be valuable\n\n### 18. **🎨 Custom Agent Prompts/Instructions**\n- **What**: Project-specific or feature-specific custom instructions that modify agent behavior (coding style, preferred libraries, etc.)\n- **Why**: The context system exists but a more structured \"agent instructions\" feature would be cleaner\n\n### 19. **⏰ Scheduled/Automated Runs**\n- **What**: Schedule features to run at specific times or trigger runs based on git events (like new commits to main)\n- **Why**: Enables CI/CD-like automation\n\n### 20. **🌐 Remote Project Support**\n- **What**: Work on projects hosted on remote servers via SSH, not just local filesystem\n- **Why**: Expands use cases to cloud development environments\n\n---\n\n## My Top 5 Recommendations (Highest Impact)\n\n1. **Feature Dependencies** - Critical for real-world project planning\n2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Great for demonstrating ROI and optimizing workflows  \n3. **Notification System** - Quality-of-life improvement for async workflows\n4. **Feature Templates** - Reduces friction in feature creation significantly\n5. **Code Review View** - Improves the verification/approval workflow which is core to the app\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these, or help plan/implement one of them?",
